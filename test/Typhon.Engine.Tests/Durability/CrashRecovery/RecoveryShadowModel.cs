/// The in-memory <b>shadow model</b> half of the T-5 differential recovery oracle (design 03 §4.2, 08 T-5). A workload records its committed lifecycle here as it
/// runs — which entities it spawned and which it destroyed — so the shadow holds an <i>independent</i> record of the alive-set, not a snapshot of the engine. Just
/// before the crash the committed component <b>values and enabled-bits are captured by reading them back through the engine's own public read API</b>
/// (<see cref="EntityRef.ReadRaw"/> / <see cref="EntityRef.IsEnabled(byte)"/>): "expected" is therefore produced by the identical code path that <see cref="Diff"/>
/// later uses to read "actual", so a byte comparison can never disagree on encoding — only on whether recovery faithfully reproduced the value.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Capture/verify are <b>per-EntityId</b> (Open/IsAlive), which work for both flat (legacy) and cluster-eligible archetypes — the broad scan
/// (<see cref="Transaction.EnumerateArchetypeEntities"/>) is only used additionally to catch resurrected/leaked entities on the flat path. This keeps the oracle
/// valid regardless of an archetype's storage path: a cluster entity that recovery fails to restore surfaces as a <c>LOST</c> diff via the per-id IsAlive check, not
/// as a silently-empty broad scan.
/// <para>Single crash point only this increment (after <c>uow.Flush()</c> — every commit durable). Mid-workload crash points (the future sweep, A1.2) will key value
/// snapshots to the durable prefix; the alive-set recording seam below is already shaped for it. Collections are a marked extension point (CollectionDelta emit is
/// still 0-callers — P1.1 residual — so nothing is logged to recover).</para>
