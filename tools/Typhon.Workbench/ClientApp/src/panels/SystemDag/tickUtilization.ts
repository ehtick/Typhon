/**
 * Parallelism-inefficiency / wait-time computation for the System DAG view's toolbar pill (A1) and
 * sparkline (A6). (The Critical Path timeline conveys parallelism via its own worker-occupancy
 * ribbon — see `criticalPath.ts` `computeWorkerOccupancy` — not a per-phase band.)
 *
 * **Formula (per Loïc's spec).**
 *
 * ```
 *   work     = Σ systemTickSummary.totalCpuUs        // CPU consumed across every worker, per system
 *   wallTime = tickSummary.durationUs                // measured tick wall-clock
 *   capacity = workerCount × wallTime                // worker-µs available
 *   wait     = capacity - work                       // worker-µs unused (parallelism inefficiency)
 *   util     = work / capacity                       // ∈ [0, 1]
 *   waitPct  = 1 - util
 * ```
 *
 * **Why `totalCpuUs` and not `durationUs`.** `durationUs` is wall-clock per system — for a parallel
 * system using 16 workers for 690 µs of wall, `durationUs = 690 µs`. The actual CPU consumed is
 * ~16 × chunk_avg ≈ 5,700 µs. Summing `durationUs` collapses parallel work into one number and
 * massively under-counts cpu use; summing `totalCpuUs` (folded by the cache builder from chunk
 * spans, chunker v13+) gives the true worker-µs consumed. Old caches default to 0 — the pill /
 * band stay hidden until the cache is rebuilt.
 *
 * `wallTime` is taken from `TickSummary.DurationUs` (engine-recorded). It includes post-tick serial
 * (WAL fsync, etc.) — single-threaded work where other workers are idle, correctly accounted as
 * "wait" under the "worker-µs unused" framing.
